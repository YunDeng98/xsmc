@dataclass
class XSMC:
    r"""Sample from, or maximize, the posterior distribution :math:`p(X_{1:N} | \mathbf{Y})` of the sequentially Markov
    coalescent.

    Args:
        ts: Tree sequence containing the data.
        focal: Leaf node in `ts` corresponding to focal haplotype.
        panel: Leaf node(s) in `ts` corresponding to panel haplotypes.
        theta: Population-scaled mutation rate. If None, Watterson's estimator is used.
        rho_over_theta: Ratio of recombination to mutation rates.
        w: Window size. Observations are binned into windows of this size. Recombinations are assumed to occur between
            adjacent bins, but not within them.
        robust: If True, use robust model in which bins are classified as either segregating or nonsegregating, as in PSMC.
            Otherwise, allow for any number of mutations per bin.

    Notes:
        The height of segments returned by this class are expressed in coalescent units. To convert to generations,
        rescale them by `self.theta / (4 * mu)`, where `mu` is the biological mutation rate.
